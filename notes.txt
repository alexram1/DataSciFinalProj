Key blocks of code I want to complete for this project:

#Imports

#load data in

	#data related to happiness scores
	
	#data related to migration

#visualize the data first

	#maybe print out some lines of the datasets

#Shape the datasets for graphing

	#how will I deal with missing data?

	#first, for happiness and migration rates now

	#second, for change in happiness and change in migraiton rates

	#third, difference in local vs foreign born happiness levels and migration rates

	#fourth, is migration related to any factor used to calculate happiness strongly?

	#fifth, use urban-rural population data and relate that to happiness scores

#preprocessing for the graphs

	#Normalizing and dealing with outliers
	
#Create some histograms to visualize migration rates and happiness of regions

#Produce the graphs for all the data above

	#Correlation between happiness and migration
